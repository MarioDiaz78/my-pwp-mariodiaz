        <p><strong><u>About me</u>:</strong>  A dedicated professional with 18 years of experience at US Foods, now transitioning to a career in web development and software development. Throughout my tenure in the warehouse industry, I honed valuable skills in problem-solving, effective communication, and task prioritization. As a team leader, I excelled in conducting pre-shift meetings, delegating tasks, and making real-time adjustments to ensure smooth operations and team efficiency.  Although I'm new to the technical aspects of the field, I firmly believe that my problem-solving skills will seamlessly translate into success in the web development and software development.  </p><br>
